# twt — Skills Marketplace

A collection of Claude Code slash commands you can install once and use across any project on any machine.

---

## What is this?

**twt** is a personal skills marketplace for Claude Code. Each skill is a `/twt-*` slash command that extends Claude with a specific capability. Clone this repo, run the installer, and the commands are immediately available in both the Claude Code CLI and the Desktop application.

---

## Quick Start

### macOS / Linux

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> twt
cd twt
bash install.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
git clone <your-repo-url> twt
cd twt
.\install.ps1
```

After installing, **restart Claude Code** (CLI or Desktop) so it picks up the new commands.

---

## Installation details

The installer recursively scans `skills/` for all `*.md` skill files and copies them flat into:

| Platform | Target directory |
|----------|-----------------|
| macOS / Linux | `~/.claude/commands/` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\commands\` |

This is the standard location that both the **Claude Code CLI** and the **Claude Code Desktop app** read from. No extra configuration required.

### Project-local install + scope guard

Install the skills into a single project instead of globally:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
bash install.sh --target /path/to/project

# Windows
.\install.ps1 -Target C:\path\to\project
```

A project-local install also seeds a **scope guard** into `<project>\.claude\settings.json`: a
`PreToolUse` hook (`.claude/hooks/twt-scope-guard.js`) that **auto-allows any tool call that stays
inside the project folder** and leaves anything reaching **outside** it to the normal approval prompt.
This removes the flood of repeated "Do you want to proceed?" prompts during a pipeline run while still
asking before anything touches a sibling project, a parent directory, or the wider filesystem.

The guard never denies outright — on any uncertainty it simply falls back to the normal prompt, so it
can only ever cost an extra confirmation, never an unwanted auto-approval. It needs **Node.js** (the hook
is a small Node script). Pass `--no-scope-guard` / `-NoScopeGuard` to skip it.

## Uninstalling

```bash
# macOS / Linux
bash uninstall.sh

# Windows
.\uninstall.ps1
```

---

## Using on a new Claude account

1. Clone this repo on the new machine
2. Run the installer
3. Done — commands are account-agnostic; they live in the local `~/.claude/` directory

Add new categories by creating a new subfolder under `skills/`. The installer
picks up any `*.md` file found anywhere inside `skills/` automatically.

---

## Adding a new skill

1. Choose the right category folder under `skills/` (or create a new one)
2. Create `twt-<your-skill>.md` inside it
3. Write the skill prompt (use `$ARGUMENTS` for anything the user types after the command name)
4. Run the installer again — the new command is deployed immediately
5. Add a row to [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md) and the category `README.md`

### Skill file template

```markdown
# /twt-your-skill-name

One-line description of what this skill does.

## Artifacts

All skills that produce output write files into `.twt-artifacts/` in the current working directory. This folder is local to each project and safe to add to `.gitignore`.

```
.twt-artifacts/
└── <skill-area>/
    └── ...
```
