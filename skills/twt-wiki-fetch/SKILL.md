# /twt-wiki-fetch

## Intent

**Purpose:** Bring an external source into the wiki's evidence layer: copy or register it under `.project-wiki/raw/`, and record it in `sources.md` so every later claim can cite it. Also covers syncing a project's existing `.twt-artifacts/` tree — pulling decision-bearing content already on disk (decisions.md items, site-log Q&A, facts.md CONFLICTs, validator BLOCKERs) into `inbox.md`, and registering every other artifact as a `sources.md` link.

**Non-goals:**
- Does not write curated pages — no `decisions/`, `entities/`, `ideas/`, `facts.md`, `index.md`, `overview.md`. That is the curator's job alone, run separately via `/twt-wiki` → `twt-wiki-define`.
- Does not interpret or synthesize. It registers evidence; it does not draw conclusions from it.
- Does not delete or edit anything already in `raw/`. Raw evidence is immutable.
- The `.twt-artifacts/` sync path is **capture, not curation**: it appends to `inbox.md` and adds rows to `sources.md` only. It never summarizes a generated file (tokens.css, a mockup, a report) into the wiki — those get a source link, nothing more.

**Success criteria:**
- Every requested source is either copied into `raw/` or registered in `sources.md` by path/URL.
- Every binary lands in `raw/assets/` and gets a row in `raw/assets.md`.
- `log.md` gains one ingest (or sync) entry.
- A `.twt-artifacts/` sync leaves `inbox.md` with new decision-bearing entries and `sources.md` with a row for everything else — and no curated page changed.
- No curated page changed.

## Step 1 — Refuse to run without a wiki
Use Glob/Read to check that `.project-wiki/AGENTS.md` exists. If it does not, stop and tell the user to run `/twt-wiki` first — that is what creates and arms the wiki. Do not create the wiki yourself.

## Step 2 — Classify each source
For each source in `$ARGUMENTS` (or ask the user for sources if none were given):

| Source | What to do |
|---|---|
| **`.twt-artifacts/` (the whole tree), or the user asks to "sync" / "harvest" existing artifacts** | Do **not** ingest by hand — run the harvester instead: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/wiki-harvest.mjs" "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"`. It scans every `decisions.md`, `facts.md`, `validation-report.md`, and site-log across `.twt-artifacts/`, appends decision-bearing entries straight to `inbox.md`, and adds a `sources.md` row for every other artifact it finds (it writes those rows itself — do not repeat them in Step 3). It is idempotent (tracked in `.project-wiki/.harvest-state.json`) and exits 0 with no output beyond a summary line when there's nothing new. **This step captures; it does not curate** — no `decisions/`, `entities/`, `facts.md`, or any other curated page is touched. Report the command's printed summary verbatim in Step 5, and remind the user the inbox still needs `/twt-wiki` → `twt-wiki-define` to turn any of this into a cited page. |
| **Binary** (logo, image, PDF brand book, font) | Copy into `.project-wiki/raw/assets/` (Bash, single `cp` command — a binary isn't text, so the Read/Write file tools don't apply). Add a row to `raw/assets.md`: file · what it is · provenance · usage constraints. |
| **Meeting note / transcript / email** | Save as Markdown under `.project-wiki/raw/meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. |
| **URL, website, Google Doc, Figma file** | Dispatch `/twt-content-fetch` (Agent tool) to extract it — never reimplement extraction. Save its clean Markdown output under `.project-wiki/raw/<slug>.md`. |
| **Pasted text** | Save verbatim under `.project-wiki/raw/<slug>.md`. |
| **A file already in the repo, or a very large file** | Do **not** copy. Register it in `sources.md` by path only. |

Copy binaries and loose local files rather than linking them: a link to a file in someone's Downloads folder is a dead link within a week.

## Step 3 — Register every source
For the `.twt-artifacts/` harvest path, skip this step — the harvester already wrote its own `sources.md` rows directly. For every other classified source, append one row per source to the table in `.project-wiki/sources.md`:

| Source | Kind | Where | Ingested |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brand book v3 | asset | `raw/assets/brand-book-v3.pdf` | 2026-07-11 |
| acme.com | site | `raw/acme-com.md` | 2026-07-11 |

Never remove or rewrite an existing row, for any reason — not even supersession. If a source supersedes an earlier one, express that only on the **new** row's `Kind` cell (e.g. `site (supersedes acme-com)`); the old row for `acme-com` is left exactly as first registered.

## Step 4 — Log
Append to `.project-wiki/log.md`. For a manual ingest:

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — ingest
Ingested <n> source(s): <list>. Registered in sources.md.
```

For a `.twt-artifacts/` harvest run, log the harvester's own summary instead:

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — sync
Ran wiki-harvest against .twt-artifacts/: <harvester's summary line, e.g. "3 harvested, 5 already present.">
```

## Step 5 — Report
Tell the user:
- Each file written, with its path
- Each source registered
- For a harvest run: the harvester's printed summary verbatim (harvested vs. already-present counts), and state explicitly that this only filled the inbox and `sources.md` — nothing was curated
- What the curator will do with it next (`/twt-wiki` runs `twt-wiki-define` to synthesize it — the user still has to run that step)
